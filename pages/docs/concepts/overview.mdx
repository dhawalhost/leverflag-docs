# Core Concepts Overview

LeverFlag is built around a few specific concepts that model how feature flags are managed and delivered.

## Hierarchy

1.  **Organization**: The top-level entity, usually representing your company.
2.  **Workspace**: A project or product line within an organization (e.g., "Mobile App", "Web Dashboard"). Feature flags live here.
3.  **Environment**: Deployment targets (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`) where flags can have different configurations.

## The Feature Flag Model

A **Feature Flag** is a named key (e.g., `new-checkout-flow`) that resolves to a value based on the context.

### Variations
Flags can return different types of data:
- **Boolean**: `true` / `false`
- **String**: `"blue"`, `"red"`
- **Number**: `10`, `50`
- **JSON**: `{ "enabled": true, "color": "blue" }`

### Rules & Targeting
You can define rules to target specific segments of users:
- **Individual Targeting**: Enable for specific user IDs.
- **Rules**: "If `email` ends with `@company.com`, return `true`".
- **Rollouts**: "Return `true` for 20% of users".

## API Keys

Clients (like your backend server or frontend app) use **API Keys** to fetch the feature flag configuration.
- API Keys are scoped to a specific Workspace.
- They are used to authenticate with the SDKs.
