# Data Exports

You can stream your raw feature evaluation logs and metric events from LeverFlag into your preferred data warehouse for advanced tracking and correlation.

## Supported Destinations

* **Amazon S3**: Export raw JSONL blobs of `FeatureFlagEvent` logs directly to an S3 bucket.
* **Snowflake**: *(Coming Soon)*
* **Google BigQuery**: *(Coming Soon)*

## Configuring an Export

Navigate to the **Data Exports** page in the LeverFlag Console Sidebar.

1. Click **New Export**.
2. Select your target **Destination** (e.g., Amazon S3).
3. Provide the **Storage Location** path (e.g., `s3://my-org-analytics-bucket/leverflag/`).
4. Select the **Time Range** (Start Date and End Date) you wish to retroactively dump data for.
5. Hit **Start Export**.

## Export Mechanics

LeverFlag creates an asynchronous background job for each request. 
The system queries the underlying database in batches, streaming the log events into JSONL (JSON Lines) format to minimize memory footprint. Those blobs are then pushed to the selected destination.

You can monitor the status on the Data Exports dashboard, tracking:
- `Processing` Statuses
- Number of Rows Extracted
- Total File Size generated

*Note: You must configure the environment with sufficient AWS credentials if running the core open-source engine yourself.*
