# Workflows

Workflows provide a safety mechanism for managing feature flags in critical environments like `production`.

## How it Works

When you attempt to save changes to a feature flag in a protected environment, instead of applying the change immediately, LeverFlag creates a **Change Request**.

## The Process

1.  **Draft**: You make changes in the console and click "Request Approval".
2.  **Pending**: The request is created and sits in a "Pending" state.
3.  **Review**: A teammate views the request, sees the diff (old vs. new configuration), and can **Approve** or **Reject** it.
4.  **Apply**: Once approved, the request can be "Applied", which pushes the configuration to the live system.

## Protected Environments

By default, the `workflow` enforcement is enabled for:
- `production`
- `prod`

This ensures that no single person can accidentally break production without a second pair of eyes.
