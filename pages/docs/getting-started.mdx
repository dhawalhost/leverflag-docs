# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up a local instance of LeverFlag using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or equivalent Docker runtime
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dhawalhost/leverflag.git
    cd leverflag
    ```

2.  **Start the stack**:
    We provide a `docker-compose.yml` file that spins up the API server, the Console, and a PostgreSQL database.

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    The initial build might take a few minutes as it compiles the Go backend and builds the React frontend.

3.  **Verify the services**:
    - **Console**: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
    - **API**: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health)

## First Run

1.  Open the Console at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
2.  You will be redirected to the login page.
3.  Register a new admin account or login if you have seeded credentials.
4.  Once logged in, you'll be taken to the onboarding wizard to create your first organization and workspace.
