# Introduction

LeverFlag is a Go-powered feature flag service that provides REST APIs for managing feature flags, distributing configuration to clients, handling analytics, and securing access with JWTs and API keys.

The platform is designed to decouple feature release from code deployment, allowing teams to ship faster and with more confidence.

## Key Features

- **Feature Flag CRUD**: Manage flags with tags, rollout percentage, targeting rules, and dependency metadata.
- **Evaluation API**: Secured by API keys for fast, client-side configuration delivery.
- **Authentication**: Supports password login, self-registration, and Google Sign-In (JWT).
- **Console Experience**: A modern React-based dashboard for managing your flags and team.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions (Admin, Editor, Viewer) for secure team collaboration.
- **Workflows**: Peer-review process for changing flags in protected environments like Production.
- **Audit Logging**: Track who changed what and when.
- **Multi-Client Support**: SDKs for JavaScript / TypeScript, Python, and more.

## Architecture

LeverFlag consists of two main components:

1.  **API Server (Backend)**: Written in Go, it handles all logic, database interactions (PostgreSQL), and API requests.
2.  **Console (Frontend)**: A React application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing the system.

Both components can be deployed easily using Docker and Docker Compose.
